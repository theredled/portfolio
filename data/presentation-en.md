I'm a freelance developer, living in Nantes (FR), specialized in **Symfony**, **back-end architecture**, **React / Next.js**, and **modular CSS**.
**Curious** and **meticulous**, I thrive in short-term projects where quick understanding, clean delivery, and adaptability are key.

Self-taught and passionate since childhood, Iâ€™ve pushed every language I had access to (*QBasic, Pascal, VB*), building custom games and tools.

Today, with over **15 years of experience**, I design, integrate, and maintain web applications of all sizes (*SaaS, white label, i18n...*), mostly using **Symfony**.
I also have solid experience in advanced CMS customization (**Magento**, **Drupal**, **Prestashop**, **Wordpress**).

Though back-end focused, I have real **frontend** expertise, especially in **pixel-perfect**, **responsive** integration and **dynamic interfaces** using Vanilla JS and more recently React / Next.js.
I'm comfortable working solo or collaborating with other developers, POs, or designers.

Always open to freelance opportunities, even short ones.
